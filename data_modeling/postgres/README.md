## Data Modeling with Postgres - Sparkify 

### Introduction 

<i>Sparkify</i> is a startup that owns a new music streaming app.
They've collected some data about songs and user activity on this app. All their data resides in two directories of JSON files: 

- Logs  on user activities;
- Songs in their app.

<i>Sparkify</i> needs to create a Postgres database to optimize queries on song play analysis. 

### Objectives

Build a ETL pipeline using Python: from JSON files to Postgres and define fact and dimension tables for a star schema.

### Datasets

- Songs: is a subset of a real data from [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). The file metadata looks like:

<code> {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0} </code>

- Logs: generated by [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim). The file looks like:

<code> {"artist":"Girl Talk","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Kaylee","gender":"F","itemInSession":8,"lastName":"Summers","length":160.15628,"level":"free","location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540344794796.0,"sessionId":139,"song":"Once again","status":200,"ts":1541107734796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"8"} </code>
